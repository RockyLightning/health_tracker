# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# 10.times do
#      Cal.create(
#         cals_burned: Faker::Internet.email,
#         password: Faker::Internen.password,
#         fname: Faker::Name.first_name,
#         lname: Faker::Name.last_name
#       )
# end
